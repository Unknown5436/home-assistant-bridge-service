# Home Assistant Bridge Service - Complete Testing Session

## Context & Current Status

I need help creating a comprehensive test suite for my **Home Assistant Bridge Service** project. Please check your memory for "Home Assistant Bridge Service Testing Session" to understand the current state.

**Current Status:**

- ✅ Service running successfully on http://127.0.0.1:8000
- ✅ All core endpoints working (health, services, states, config, metrics, status)
- ✅ Authentication and rate limiting working correctly
- ✅ Performance excellent (0.9s average response time)
- ✅ Error handling robust with proper 404 and connection error management
- ✅ Prometheus metrics and monitoring fully functional
- ✅ Home Assistant server is back online after maintenance
- ✅ All previous issues fixed (500 errors, auth, routing conflicts, cached decorator)

**Previous Session Achievements:**

- Fixed 500 Internal Server Error in `/api/v1/services/all` endpoint
- Root cause was HA API returning list instead of dict format - fixed by converting list to dict
- Fixed multiple issues: status endpoint auth, states router conflict, cached decorator compatibility
- Achieved 100% test success rate on core functionality
- Service is production-ready with 1,186 entities accessible

## What I Need

Create a **single comprehensive Python test script** that tests every aspect of the Home Assistant Bridge Service:

### Core Functionality Tests

1. **API Endpoints Testing**

   - Health endpoints (`/health`, `/api/v1/config/health`, `/status`)
   - States management (`/api/v1/states/all`, `/api/v1/states/{entity_id}`)
   - Services management (`/api/v1/services/all`, `/api/v1/services/domain/{domain}`)
   - Metrics endpoint (`/metrics`)

2. **Authentication & Security**

   - API key authentication (valid/invalid keys)
   - Rate limiting functionality
   - Protected vs public endpoint access
   - Error handling for unauthorized requests

3. **Performance & Caching**

   - Response time measurements
   - Caching effectiveness
   - Multiple request performance
   - Load testing capabilities

4. **Error Handling**

   - 404 handling for non-existent endpoints
   - Invalid entity handling
   - Connection error handling
   - Graceful failure management

5. **Advanced Features**

   - Service calls (when HA is accessible)
   - Batch operations
   - WebSocket status checking
   - Real-time state updates

6. **Integration Testing**
   - Direct Home Assistant API connectivity
   - End-to-end workflow testing
   - Data consistency validation
   - Service call execution

### Test Script Requirements

The test script should:

- **Be a single Python file** (`test_complete_ha_bridge.py`)
- **Test all endpoints systematically** with clear pass/fail reporting
- **Include performance metrics** and timing analysis
- **Provide detailed error reporting** when tests fail
- **Support different test modes** (quick, comprehensive, stress)
- **Generate a test report** with summary statistics
- **Be easily runnable** with `python test_complete_ha_bridge.py`
- **Include configuration** for different environments (dev, staging, prod)

### Environment Details

**Service Configuration:**

- Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- API Key: `test-api-key-12345`
- Home Assistant URL: `https://raspberrypieha.duckdns.org:8123`
- Home Assistant Token: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJlMzIyY2ExZGE2YWU0MGY3YjllMDk3NzAyZDkxMWUxOCIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTE1ODM0OSwiZXhwIjoyMDc2NTE4MzQ5fQ.lsTEbb1yJ7DYJoIg3izFG35QeybgWR6PLpMJ0arf3wM`

**Expected Results:**

- All core functionality should pass (previously achieved 100% success rate)
- Service calls should work now that HA is back online
- Performance should remain excellent (< 1.0s response times)
- Comprehensive coverage of all service capabilities

## Technical Stack Context

**Home Assistant Bridge Service:**

- FastAPI-based intermediary service for Cursor AI to interact with Home Assistant API
- Technical stack: FastAPI, HTTPX, WebSocket, Prometheus metrics, Docker
- Key endpoints: `/api/v1/states`, `/api/v1/services`, `/api/v1/config`, `/health`, `/metrics`
- Security: API key authentication, rate limiting, SSL/TLS support
- Advanced features: in-memory caching with TTL, real-time updates, batch operations
- Environment: Python 3.9+, FastAPI, Docker

## Deliverables

1. **Single comprehensive test script** (`test_complete_ha_bridge.py`)
2. **Test execution instructions** and usage examples
3. **Expected output format** and success criteria
4. **Troubleshooting guide** for common test failures
5. **Performance benchmarks** and optimization recommendations

The test script should be production-ready and provide confidence that the entire Home Assistant Bridge Service is working correctly across all functionality areas.

Please create this comprehensive test suite to validate every aspect of the service!
